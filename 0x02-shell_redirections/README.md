# I/O Redirections Directory

- This directory consits of illustrations with the regards to Input/Output Redirections and Special Characters.
- Input redirections (<), these redirect the Standard input (Keyboard) in to a input from a different source (e.g text file)
- Output redirections (>), these redirect the output of a command from the Standard Oput put to a disired location ( e.g <file_name>)
- Common commands: echo, cat, head, tail, find, wc, sort, uniq, grep, tr, rev, cut, passwd (5).

# Some of the concepts:

- Function of the commands head, tail, find, wc, sort, uniq, grep, tr.
- Pipelines and filters: Pipelines(|) stack and combine commmands.
- Special characters : *, \\, $, ?, '.
- A preceeding backslash (\\) and ' ' (single quotes) suppress special characters.
